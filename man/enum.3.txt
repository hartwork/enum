NAME
----

enum - number generator as used by enum


DESCRIPTION
-----------

*libenum* provides the generator used to enumerate values (numbers) from 'left'
to 'right' adding/subtracting 'step' each time.  If 'step' is not provided a
value is implied.  No more than 'count' values are returned.

HEADER FILES
------------

There is 'enum.h' which you can include to get all functionality you need. It's
actually a wrapper for 'enum/generator.h' (the main file) which in turn include
'enum/utils.h'. You should not use anything you find there that isn't
documented here. The library is still subject to change.

DATA STRUCTURES
---------------

scaffolding
~~~~~~~~~~~

That's the main structure. It contains 'flags' (see below), the 'left' and
'right' borders, the 'step' between calculated values, and the 'count' of
numbers to return all in all.

Other values stored there are unused, used internally or subject to future
change. Do not work with them.

yield_status
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Enumeration of possible return values of the important enum_yield function. See
below for expected return values.

scaffolding_flags
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Enumeration of flags used by the scaffolding structure. Don't mess with them.

API FUNCTIONS
-------------

void 'enum_initialize_scaffold'(scaffolding *)::
    Use this function to initialize your 'scaffolding'. It sets a few internals
    needed by the library.

void 'enum_complete_scaffold'(scaffolding *)::
    After you've filled your 'scaffolding' with the values you know (by user
    input or however), this function completes it in order to be able to
    calculate the numbers. Everything that's not calcuable will be filled with
    default values (usually 1).

yield_status 'enum_yield'(scaffolding *, float *)::
    This function is your friend when it comes to the actual values. Provided
    with your scaffolding (after it's completed), 'yield_status' will fill the
    given float pointer with the next value if there is any. In other words,
    call this function as often as values are calculated.
    The return values, as provided by above-said enumeration, are 'YIELD_MORE'
    if another value is expected or 'YIELD_LAST' if not.
