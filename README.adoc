Enum

https://github.com/hartwork/enum/releases[*DOWNLOADS*]

*enum* is:

* http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html[Free Software]
* a command line tool to  ..
** enumerate values
** produce random numbers
* highly portable
* tested
* beyond version 1.0

Example:
-------------------------------------------------------------
# enum -e 8 11
08
09
10
11
-------------------------------------------------------------

*enum* came into being as a union of the features from GNU _seq_
and BSD _jot_, two previously existing tools doing similar work.
